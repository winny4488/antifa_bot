## ðŸš€ About the Bot
- This bot, regardless of interface, is instructed to answer queries as truthfully as possible. Due to quirks with the programming or the llm tech itself, it won't deliver good dialogue if you are not asking **specific** questions (avoid "can you explain that?", try "can you explain the steps to achieve communism?").
- If the bot responds to the wrong parts of your message, you can use the !komuna refine command to give it another shot. You can also do !komuna clear to erase the memory without restarting, and !komuna help for all commands.
- Komuna was trained on the sources listed in trained_data.txt
- Download Size: 2.7GB
- Expands to 10GB
